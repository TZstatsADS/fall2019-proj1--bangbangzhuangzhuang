### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: optimism or pessimism?
+ This project is conducted by Jie Jin

+ Project summary: This report is based on the "lyrics.RData". Frist, I cleaned the data and created own data set "word_lyrics.RData" (the document is too large to upload). Then I did data analysis. Find that American poets use “LOVE” a lot, the frequency is 6 times bigger than the second-used word. It gives us a misconception that most american poets are optimism, however, when we consider the whole positive words ratio VS nagative words ratio, most american poets are pessimism!
